## Q: 2

Smart Data Aggregator
Create a function aggregateData that takes an array of transactions and returns a summary with multiple statistics grouped by category.

Requirements:

Group transactions by category
Calculate total amount, average amount, and count per category
Find the highest and lowest transaction in each category
Round averages to 2 decimal places
Test Case:

const transactions = [
  { id: 1, category: 'Food', amount: 45.50, date: '2024-01-15' },
  { id: 2, category: 'Transport', amount: 20.00, date: '2024-01-16' },
  { id: 3, category: 'Food', amount: 30.75, date: '2024-01-17' },
  { id: 4, category: 'Entertainment', amount: 50.00, date: '2024-01-18' },
  { id: 5, category: 'Food', amount: 25.25, date: '2024-01-19' },
  { id: 6, category: 'Transport', amount: 15.50, date: '2024-01-20' }
];

const result = aggregateData(transactions);
console.log(result);

/* Expected Output:
{
  Food: {
    total: 101.50,
    average: 33.83,
    count: 3,
    highest: 45.50,
    lowest: 25.25
  },
  Transport: {
    total: 35.50,
    average: 17.75,
    count: 2,
    highest: 20.00,
    lowest: 15.50
  },
  Entertainment: {
    total: 50.00,
    average: 50.00,
    count: 1,
    highest: 50.00,
    lowest: 50.00
  }
}
